Description:

Chapter-1: Explores basics like Fabry-Perot resonators and the development of coupled-mode theory in its full generality.
           The folder contains codes and results for a basic Fabry-Perot resonator and the transmission characteristics 
           resulting from coupled-mode theory (CMT).

Chapter 2: Coupled-Mode theory was extended to the case of an all-pass and an add-drop ring resonator. The folder contains
           codes and results for the transmission and phase-shift for an all-pass ring resonator resulting from CMT, and the
           transmission characteristics via the through and drop ports of an add-drop ring resonator.

Chapter 3: CMT was applied to the case of a ring connected containing an electro-optic modulator (EOM). The folder contains
           theoretical results when the tone applied to an EOM is the same frequency as the Free-Spectral range (FSR) of the ring.
           Other theoretical results include when the input voltage is higher than the half-wave voltage, applied tone is twice 
           the FSR, or a superposition of FSR and twice the FSR with a pi/2 phase-shift and a voltage ratio of 1:0.8, or a 
           superposition of FSR and thrice the FSR with a voltage ratio of 1:3.
